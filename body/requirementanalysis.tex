    Searching for Menu Items, and Reading Reviews.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Guest}}---a group of user which extends from base functionalities, they are able to Sign Up and Login.
    \item \textbf{\textit{Member}}---an authorized group of user, being able to Write Reviews, Rate Menu Items and Edit their Profiles.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Interface Design}
\label{section:user-interface-design}

The main concept is that KU Eater's interface design prioritizes user-friendliness and an intuitive navigation experience,
taking inspiration from various successful application platforms. While KU Eater is a web-based application,
the user interface is presented in a mobile frame to demonstrate the versatility and mobile-first approach that aligns with
the on-the-go lifestyle of Kasetsart University students.\footnote{Application mockup demonstration is available at: \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4CBDDqBZ2SA}}
The figures below are the designs that aligns with our philosophy,

\section{Target and Development System}
\label{section:development-system}

\subsection{Data Preparation}
\label{subsection:data-preparation-system}
In order to prepare data for KU Eater, proper tooling is needed both for data storage and retrieval. The following list is the technologies we used in data preparation:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
    \item \textbf{Google Sheets:} In order to record interview results such as stall information, list of menu items, we decided to use Google Sheets as our storage for raw data\footnote{The spreadsheet containing the data: \url{https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oQ_PykNVvtV5KKtKOrva9aiZeK4S42EuFP9S6qaO4cg}}.
    The advantage of this tool is that we have faster access to data, especially when we are doing interviews with data holders.
    \item \textbf{PostgreSQL:} PostgreSQL is a relational database system, one of the advantages that PostgreSQL offers is the synchronous replication, we can use that feature in order to separate between the master data store, and sandbox database for training ML models.
    PostgreSQL is used as our main datastore. PostgreSQL also has vector support for AI-driven applications.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recommendation Engine}
\label{subsection:recommendation-engine}
KU Eater at its core features a recommendation system, in order to build a consistent and fast service, we chose the following technologies:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
    \item \textbf{gRPC:} A high performant protocol to do Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) that allows us to share schemas between
    services. This allows for consistent data throughout the application's scope and predictable behavior.
    \item \textbf{Tonic:} A gRPC server based on the Rust programming language. It is performant and can be
    used to serve data asynchronously for a near real-time experience.
    \item \textbf{PostgreSQL:} Like in the step of Data Preparation (\ref{subsection:data-preparation-system}), we can use replication to our advantage to update data in real-time
    both from autonomous systems or administrator edits.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Web Application}
\label{subsection:web-application}
KU Eater as a web-based mobile application, needs an interface designed with a target of mobile phone users in mind.
In order to complement our requirements, our approach to the development process of the application must be mobile-first.
The following is the technology stack of KU Eater web application:

\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=80pt]
    \item \textbf{React Native:} React Native is a framework based on React that offers powerful data fetching functionalities, built-in caching using existing web technologies etc. \\
    The framework is native to Javascript, and can ensure its compatibility across devices. It is used as our frontend for the application and a mediator between the backend.
\end{itemize}
