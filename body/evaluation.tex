\chapter{Knowledge and Skills Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
This chapter presents the evaluation of KU Eater as a whole, the sources of evaluation comes from, an artificial intelligence using a large language model,
the students who worked on KU Eater reflecting on AI's response and re-evaluate with their own set of scores, and finally from the advisor peer reviewing both
evaluations and this report.

\section{Evaluation Criteria}
\label{section:evaluation-criteria}
The criteria for evaluation is divided into 5 rubrics, Software Development \& Programming, Data Management \& Analysis,
Machine Learning \& AI, Critical \& Creative Thinking, and Collaboration \& Communication. All rubrics are on a 4-point system indicating
proficiency of KU Eater team members from Basic to Expert. The rubrics have their grading policies based on table \ref{table:evaluation-criteria}.

\section{AI Evaluation}
\label{section:ai-evaluation}
The first step in evaluation is to use AI with large language model to evaluate KU Eater. The evaluation of the AI is based on what
presents in this report. The prompt for the AI was standardized by the course's instructor as followed,

\begin{verbatim}
You are provided with a LaTeX document
containing student materials.

Show the title of the project and
summarize the project in 5 lines.

Evaluate and rate each student based on their
demonstrated skills in the following five areas:

    Software Development & Programming

    Data Management & Analytics

    Machine Learning & AI

    Critical & Creative Thinking

    Collaboration & Communication

Use the rubric below to assign a score (1-4)

The AI produced the following scores along with its justification,

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \small\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| >{\hsize=.8\hsize}X | >{\hsize=.2\hsize}X | >{\hsize=2.0\hsize}X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Skill Area} & \textbf{Score} & \textbf{Justification} \\\hline
        \textbf{Software Development \& Programming} & 3 & Designed and implemented a full-stack, scalable, modular application from scratch across multiple technologies, adhering to coding standards, using advanced frameworks (React Native, Rust, Tonic), and effective source control, all indicating advanced programming maturity. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Data Management \& Analytics} & 3 & Their data practices include designing normalized schemas for complex menu/user/review data, using PostgreSQL/pgvector for high-performance analytics and embeddings, integrating cloud data acquisition, and using ETL/stored procedures for workflow automation, all at an advanced undergraduate level. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Machine Learning \& AI} & 3 & They not only used but fine-tuned NLP models, engineered features for the recommender, managed embeddings, measured real evaluation metrics, debugged model issues (bias/imbalance), and integrated ML pipelines into production—showing hands-on strength beyond simple API use. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Critical \& Creative Thinking} & 3 & The students identified systematic UX and data problems, iterated their design (e.g., streamlined onboarding, advanced recommendation scoring), leveraged creative combinations of AI and user feedback, and adapted project goals to practical constraints. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Collaboration \& Communication} & 3 & Project progress was consistently managed and reported, with real evidence of user feedback cycles, faculty interaction, project exhibitions, and effective Agile collaboration. Team communication was systematic and impactful. \\ \hline

\end{table}

\section{Re-evaluation by Students}
\label{section:reevaluation}
The second step is for the authors or project members to review the AI's justification of its scoring from \ref{table:ai-evaluation}, then re-evaluate and give another justification
on why the new set of scores are valid. The review is required since AI can potentially bias towards users, or its system prompt is specified
for it to be encouraging users. The following is the new set of scores after reviewing the AI's,

\begin{table}[ht!]
    \centering
    \small\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{| >{\hsize=.8\hsize}X | >{\hsize=.2\hsize}X | >{\hsize=2.0\hsize}X |}
        \hline
        \textbf{Skill Area} & \textbf{Score} & \textbf{Justification} \\\hline
        \textbf{Software Development \& Programming} & 3 & After reading the AI, we agreed a little on the part that we developed the project with an intention for scalable services. Our infrastructure exists a framework to handle future scaling and ensure availability. Therefore, we think this is reasonable. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Data Management \& Analytics} & \textbf{2} & We did have data pipelines, however the pipelines were not as complex to receive high praise. We thought that Intermediate is suitable because we only have the capabilities for optimized database operations at best. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Machine Learning \& AI} & 3 & We successfully deployed our agent which is the model to production, along with able to fine-tune our own model. We thought Advanced is a suitable skill level. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Critical \& Creative Thinking} & \textbf{2} & Our solution overlapped with many existing solutions and to say if we made innovative marvels would be a stretch. We were only able to identify an existing problem and we tried to deliver. \\ \hline
        \textbf{Collaboration \& Communication} & 3 & The technical findings are presented per requirement of this course. Additionally, documentation and Git proficiency is our bare minimum to do this project anyway. \\ \hline
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Re-evaluation by Students}
    \label{table:student-reevaluation}
\end{table}

We reduced scores in areas where we thought the requirements weren't fulfilled, we were surprised that the AI gave reasonable scores and does not try to puts its optimism as bias.
We speculated that the cause of better AI answers are: (1) Not being logged in, or not having user data actually sent to AI, (2) Having all of our data in text format instead of a PDF,
and (3) Using OpenRouter to call the OpenAI's API directly instead.
